We've published our very first prototype.
It is NOT for the public service yet. so the system is uncomplete and unstable.
Please refer the situation, if you want to try it.

- You can test the Comment SaaS function by adding only one line code `<script src="//5ay.it/now.js">` on your website.
- You can make a Topic page, which can lead a debate with anonymous visitors.
- You can login by Google or GitHub account.

The current status is **only for showing the very basic core concepts of 5ay.it**.
The next prototype will be release on early Mar. 2022, and we're planning to start the Public Beta from Jul. 2022.

Thank you for your reading. ðŸ˜˜
